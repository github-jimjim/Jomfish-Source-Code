# Jomfish-Source-Code
## This is the repository for my chess bots first versions

# Introduction
This is a rust based chess engine and I will share the very first versions of my successful Jomfish Bot with **3300** Elo.

# Versions
Here are the versions listed that I released with source code:
Version 2.0

# Infos
I would be really happy if you could train a nnue or something sothat I could integrate it in Jomfish 10. If your NNUE trainer is that goood and improves Jomfish 10 
I will share you the source code of Jomfish 10 included the trainer.

# Usage
The version 2.0 doesn't support any special UCI commands only the normal ones without any Configuration like Overhead or Threads. Compile it and use it in any arena iof your choice.

# Compilation process
Compile it with:
```cargo build --release```
